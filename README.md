# AI-Powered Documentation Project

This project demonstrates the use of DITA and Oxygen XML for creating documentation. The content is deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used:
- **DITA**: A standard for creating topic-based documentation.
- **Oxygen XML**: A powerful XML editor for creating and managing DITA files.
- **GitHub Pages**: A static site hosting service for deploying the documentation.

## How It Works:
1. The documentation was written in DITA format using Oxygen XML Editor.
2. The content is organized into topics, which are then compiled into an HTML format using Oxygen's transformation scenarios.
3. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, with links between different documentation topics.

## Project Structure:
- **HTML Files**: Contain the main documentation content.
- **CSS**: Provides custom styling for the page (via `styles.css`).
- **GitHub Pages**: Used for deployment.
