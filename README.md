# AI-Powered Documentation Project

This project showcases the use of **DITA** (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) and **Oxygen XML** to create structured, topic-based documentation that is deployed using **GitHub Pages**. The goal is to demonstrate how a modern technical writer can use XML-based standards for documentation and manage everything within an automated deployment process.

## Technologies Used:
- **DITA**: A widely adopted standard for creating topic-based documentation. It enables content reuse and efficient maintenance.
- **Oxygen XML**: A comprehensive XML editor used to write, edit, and transform DITA content into various formats, including HTML and PDF.
- **GitHub Pages**: A free service from GitHub that allows static content to be hosted directly from a GitHub repository.

## How It Works:
1. **Writing the Documentation**: The content for this documentation was authored using DITA, which structures the content into reusable topics. Each topic is a single unit of information, making it easy to manage and update.
2. **Transformation with Oxygen XML**: Using Oxygen XML Editor, the DITA files are transformed into HTML format via transformation scenarios that follow predefined templates. This step allows the content to be presented as a cohesive, easily accessible webpage.
3. **Hosting on GitHub Pages**: Once the content is ready, it is pushed to GitHub and deployed via **GitHub Pages**, which provides free hosting for static websites.
4. **Interlinking Topics**: The documentation includes multiple interlinked topics that users can navigate to explore related content.

## Project Structure:
- **`index.html`**: The main landing page of the documentation, providing an overview of the topics and links to the relevant sections.
- **`*.html` Files**: These files contain individual topics of the documentation.
- **`styles.css`**: A custom CSS file providing the design and layout for the documentation pages.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used to deploy the website publicly. All pages are hosted directly from the GitHub repository, ensuring easy access and real-time updates.
